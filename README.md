# House Price Prediction Model

ðŸš€ **First step towards Machine Learning!**  

This project demonstrates a **Linear Regression model implemented from scratch** in Python to predict house prices. No machine learning libraries were used for the core implementation â€” just NumPy for numerical operations and Matplotlib for visualization.

## **Features**

- Gradient Descent implementation from scratch  
- Polynomial feature transformations to improve accuracy  
- Comparison with scikit-learnâ€™s Linear Regression results  
- Visualization of cost reduction over iterations

## **Dataset**

- The notebook uses a dataset containing features such as:  
  - `indus` â€” Industrial proportion  
  - `nox` â€” Nitric oxide concentration  
  - `rm` â€” Average number of rooms  
  - `ptratio` â€” Pupil-teacher ratio  
  - `tax` â€” Property tax rate  
  - `lstat` â€” % lower status population  
  - `age` â€” Proportion of older buildings  
  - `dis` â€” Distance to employment centers  
- Target variable: `target_price` â€” House price
